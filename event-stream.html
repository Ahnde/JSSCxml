<h1>JSSCxml's <code>&lt;invoke type="event-stream"&gt;</code></h1>

<p>The event-stream connection type uses the EventSource's event-stream protocol to receive events from a Web server over a persistent HTTP connection. It is a one-way stream: sending information back to the server must be done through another channel, such as <code>fetch</code>.</p>

<p>While limited, it has the advantage of working over HTTP, it is standard, simple and robust, and fills an important role in client-side software.</p>

<p>The full URI of the type should be "http://www.jsscxml.org/event-stream/" and the short-hand name used in JSSC is "event-stream".</p>

<section><h1>Valid targets</h1>

<p>Any URI supported by the underlying EventSource implementation. In Web browsers, that means any HTTP URL (of course, it will still fail if the server doesn't reply with an event-stream at that location).</p>

</section>

<section><h1>Data encoding</h1>

<p>The <em>event:</em> descriptor <em>must not</em> be used in the event-stream to indicate the name of events, since the EventSource wrapper is a DOM EventTarget interface and it would be silly to implement another one just to be able to react to all events. Instead, events are transmitted as default-named messages with <em>data:</em> lines, the first of which sets the event name (after trimming any white space). If more lines are present, they must contain a single JSON-like representation of the event data:</p>

<pre>data: event.name
data:{
data:	var1: 1,
data:	var2: /regex/
data:}</pre>

<p>Note that the data in the above example is not JSON because the property names are unquoted and one of the values is a litteral RegExp. The only requirement in this specification is that implementations <em>must</em> support basic JSON and fall back to plain text. However, they <em>may</em> support better JavaScript serializations.</p>

<p>On an implementation that only supports basic JSON, the resulting event will be:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>name</dt>
	<dd>"event.name"</dd>
	<dt>origin</dt>
	<dd>"#_"+<var>invokeid</var></dd>
	<dt>origintype</dt>
	<dd>"event-stream"</dd>
	<dt>type</dt>
	<dd>"external"</dd>
	<dt>sendid</dt>
	<dd>undefined</dd>
	<dt>invokeid</dt>
	<dd><var>invokeid</var></dd>
	<dt>data</dt>
	<dd>"{\n\tvar1: 1,\n\tvar2: /regex/\n}"</dd>
</dl>

<p>The data field contains an unparsed string because the basic JSON parser failed. A platform with a better parser would put the intended object there instead.</p>

</section>

<section><h1>Server-side termination</h1>

<p>The connection terminates in all the usual conditions for the EventSource interface; also, if it receives an event that matches "done.*", it will terminate after dispatching that event.</p>

</section>

<section><h1>Children</h1>

<p>No payload nor custom headers may be sent to the target for initialization, so only <code>param</code>s or <code>content</code> with an object value, and <code>finalize</code> are allowed. Note that an empty <code>finalize</code> will not work if the received event data cannot be parsed as an object.</p>
